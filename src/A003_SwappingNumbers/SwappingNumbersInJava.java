/*
 * Write a program to swap two numbers with and without using third variable?
 * Swapping of Numbers: Swapping two numbers means exchanging the values of two variables.
 * 						It is done by two ways
 * 						1. With using third variable
 * 						2. Without using third variable
 * Ex:  var a = 100;                        a = 200;
 *          b = 200;      After Swapping    b = 100;
